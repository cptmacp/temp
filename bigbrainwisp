so as wisp 

in 5/6x you have to 

1. take 4 shields on the first run ( as well as pick 2 lure in middle )

2. from 2nd run onwards always rush to terry,propa spam then put mote, 
immediately get 2 lure park asap, then pick 5 more lure and charge at least 3 while Garry is crying 
( before Garry crying phase, you should have at least 3 charged lure out of 5


3. after some experience and practice, you can help water shields
but as a starter wisp, let's say you parked 2 during terry and picking 5 and managed to charge 1 or 2 out of 5
you should go a little later to Garry, else your lure will link and then you have to park it, it's not a big deal 
but you have to know when to delink it, else eidolon will tp

4. always put mote (red and green, haste/health) on common spots or mark the motes

5. if you charge all 5 during Garry down, or before he is crying, you charge your vs and help in hydro shields

6. for terry shields on 1st run, it's a little hard to pick 2 lure and takedown shields as starter wisp, so try to
 pick 1 lure and then go to terry on the first run, but park the lure back if DPS got 2 souls only, because he will get 1 under terry

7. always try to avoid lure under eidolon, it blocks vs shots and dps FOV

8. keep magus repair for dps during cap shots, it's nice to do that during hydro cap shot, 
since hydro does a lot of damage

9. know places and lure spawn location and lure spawn mechanics and force spawn mechanics, 
this comes with experience so watch some videos and see force spawn locations.

10. usually playing wisp people avoid going to eidolon when dps caps it, try to pick 5 lure, and collect voum when dps is about to cap terry.

11. never pick 5 lure and go to terry, unless dps has all 3 charged lure
